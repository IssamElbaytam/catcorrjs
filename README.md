catcorr.js
==========

The goal of catcorr.js is to make it easy to explore correlations
between categorical variables. This is an exploratory tool that is
intended to help generate hypotheses and tell stories about the data
that you are examining. Particularly when it comes to survey data
&mdash; where the ultimate goal is oftentimes to understand something
about a group of people &mdash; catcorr.js is particularly well suited
for revealing patterns and tendency of the people in question.
