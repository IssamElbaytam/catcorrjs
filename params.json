You're really going to be able\r\nto quantify exactly what types of people responded this time, aren't\r\nyou? Oh yeah, you've got this whole thing figured out: \"I'm just going\r\nto cluster those little buggers and this will all make so much more\r\nsense.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then you try to\r\n[cluster them into groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis).\r\n\r\nAnd you discover, yet again, that there aren't any useful or\r\nmeaningful groups. Sad times.\r\n\r\nEnter catcorr.js --- short for _cat_egorical _corr_elation --- which\r\nmakes it easy to visualize relationships between categorical variables\r\n(*e.g.*, results from a survey). The goal of this tool is not to\r\nidentify a finite number of groups of people that summarize your\r\npopulation as a whole. Rather, the goal of catcorr.js is to make it\r\npossible to quickly visualize the actual data to generate hypotheses\r\nand visually evaluate the data in a useful way. Something like this:\r\n\r\nXXXX EMBED SCREENCAST VIDEO HERE\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\ncatcorr.js is built on top of [d3.js](d3js.org) and\r\n[crossfilter.js](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/). The quick way\r\nto get started is to\r\n\r\n1. *Setup the html*. Insert a `div` into the body of your webpage and\r\n   be sure to include the d3.js and crossfilter.js dependencies\r\n\r\n    ```html\r\n    <div id=\"example\"></div>\r\n    <script src=\"d3.min.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"crossfilter.min.js\"></script>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. *Format the json*. Compile your data into a json that holds the\r\n    questions (*e.g.*, the dimensions of your classification) and the\r\n    responses from all of the respondents:\r\n\r\n\t```javascript\r\n\tvar data = {\r\n\t  questions: [\r\n\t\t{number: 1, type: \"outcome\", text: \"Which came first?\", choices: [\"chicken\", \"egg\"]},\r\n\t\t{number: 2, type: \"outcome\", text: \"How tall are you?\", choices: [\"short\", \"tall\"]},\r\n\t\t{number: 3, type: \"demographic\", text: \"Gender\", choices: [\"male\", \"female\"]},\r\n\t\t{number: 4, type: \"demographic\", text: \"Genus\", choices: [\"amoeba\", \"multi-cellular organism\"]},\r\n\t  ],\r\n\t  responses: [\r\n\t\t{1: \"chicken\", 2: \"short\", 3: \"male\", 4: \"amoeba\"},\r\n\t\t{1: \"egg\", 2: \"tall\", 3: \"male\", 4: \"multi-cellular organism\"},\r\n\t\t{1: \"egg\", 2: \"tall\", 3: \"female\", 4: \"multi-cellular organism\"},\r\n\t\t{1: \"chicken\", 2: \"tall\", 3: \"female\", 4: \"multi-cellular organism\"},\r\n\t    // ...\r\n\t  ]\r\n\t}\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n3. *catcorr time*. \r\n\r\n\t```javascript\r\n\tvar cc = catcorr(\"#example\", data);\r\n\t```\r\n\r\nThere is also a\r\n[working example](https://github.com/deanmalmgren/catcorrjs/blob/master/example/index.html). To\r\nview it, clone this repository, run `make`, and then open\r\n`example/index.html` in your browser.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-43894210-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
